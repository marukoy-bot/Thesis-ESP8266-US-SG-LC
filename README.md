After powering on, the motor will start. 
After the ESP8266 is connected to the Internet via WiFi, in the Blynk app/website press the "Pump" button to turn the Pump off.
If the ESP8266 can't connect to the WiFi/Hotspot, remove the **G** and **Vin** wires connected to the ESP8266 and reboot it. Connect the wires back **CORRECTLY** after it connects to the WiFi.
